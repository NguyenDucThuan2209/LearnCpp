LITERALS
+ Consider the following 2 statements:
    std::cout << "Hello world!";
    int x{5};
    â†’ What are "Hello World!" and '5'? They are literals. A literal (also known as a literal constant) is a fixed value that has been inserted directly into the source code.
+ Literals and variables both have a value (and a type). Unlike a variable (whose value can be set and changed through initialization and assignment respectively), the value of a literal is fixed and cannot be changed. The literal 5 always has value 5. This is why literals are called constants.
+ To further highlight the difference between literals and variables, let's examine this short program:
